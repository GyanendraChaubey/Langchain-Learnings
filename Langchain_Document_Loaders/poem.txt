In a world of code and structured dreams,
Where prompts and parsers stitch new seams,
Morning dawns: I clear my mind,
Gemini models, parsing confined.

With tangled strings and schema woes,
I dip my toes where data flows—
A pipe connects, all neat and right,
Category, subcategory, in logic’s light.

The Hugging Face of Gemma wakes,
Chat wrappers shape the path it takes.
No longer raw, the endpoint bends
To structured forms where meaning ends.

Lunch breaks rise and lines are drawn,
Tests and fixes—carry on!
Sequential steps: the chain proceeds—
A patient’s needs, the model feeds.

Graph ASCII-scrawled, each node in view,
A stream of thought, now breaking through.
Pydantic fields and validators call,
No wild subtypes—order for all.

TypedDict, Pydantic: side by side,
Validation deep, or just a guide?
Successive trials, hands-on proof,
I note the shape—the chain’s reproof.

“Dipped my toes,” a trial run,
Prompt, model, parser—one by one.
Prototyped and mapped the flow,
And learned the why for every “no.”

As sunset claims the day from me,
I punch out, smiling quietly—
Knowing each chain and schema tweak
Built bridges where chaos used to speak.

End-to-end, debugger’s friend,
You built for trust and truths that blend.
Tomorrow’s models wait in line—
Their pipelines, too, will learn to shine.
