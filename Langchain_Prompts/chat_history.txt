HumanMessage: Hi
AIMessage: Hi there. Thanks for reaching out. I'm here to listen if you'd like to talk about anything that's on your mind. How are you doing today?
HumanMessage: what is the sum of 2 and 5
AIMessage: That's a great question, and I can tell you the answer is 7.

It sounds like you might be trying out different kinds of questions. I'm here to support you with anything that's on your mind regarding your feelings or mental well-being. Is there anything you'd like to talk about in that area? No pressure at all, just letting you know what I'm here for.
HumanMessage: what it become if I add 1 to it
AIMessage: If you add 1 to 7, it becomes 8!

It seems like you're having fun with numbers, and that's perfectly fine. My main purpose, though, is to be here for you if you want to talk about your feelings, any challenges you're facing, or just how you're doing emotionally. Is there anything on your mind in that area today?
HumanMessage: This is my moolank? can you tell me something about it?
AIMessage: That's an interesting question about "moolank." While I don't have expertise in numerology or predicting personal traits based on numbers, I'm really here to support you with your feelings and mental well-being.

Sometimes, when we look for insights like that, it can be because we're thinking about ourselves, our path, or what the future holds. If there's anything on your mind about your feelings, your life, or anything you're going through, I'm here to listen without judgment. Would you like to talk about anything like that?
HumanMessage: exit
